Right then, let's explore how to register paths to define how URL requests are handled in Drupal using the Routing system and Menu API.
The ability to register paths and define URL request handling is fundamental when developing custom modules in Drupal, as indicated by the self-assessment table's focus on developing custom modules using the Drupal API [4.2].
Drupal's Routing System is responsible for mapping incoming HTTP requests to executable code, typically a controller that returns a response [your general Drupal knowledge]. To define a route, you need to create a routing.yml file within your custom module [your general Drupal knowledge, likely elaborated upon in the "Creating modules" documentation]. This file declares the paths your module will handle, the controller that will be executed for each path, and any access requirements or other route parameters [your general Drupal knowledge].
While the provided excerpts don't explicitly detail the structure of a routing.yml file, the "Creating custom modules (D.O)" link will undoubtedly provide comprehensive information on how to define routes. This documentation will likely cover aspects such as:
•
Defining the path itself (e.g., /my-custom-path).
•
Specifying the _controller service that will handle the request (pointing to a method within a class).
•
Setting _title to define the page title.
•
Defining _access requirements to control who can access the path (e.g., permissions or roles).
•
Using placeholders in the path to accept dynamic arguments.
The "Getting started - Background & Prerequisites" documentation might provide foundational context for understanding how Drupal handles requests, though it's less likely to delve into the specifics of routing configuration. Similarly, the documentation on "Namespaces" and "PSR-4 namespaces and autoloading in Drupal 8", along with the "Namespaces overview", are crucial for structuring your custom module's code, including your controller classes that are referenced in your routing definitions. These ensure that Drupal can correctly locate and execute your code [your general Drupal knowledge].
The Menu API in Drupal is used to create and manage navigation menus [2.5]. While the Routing system defines the URLs and their associated code, the Menu API allows you to create links to these URLs within Drupal's navigation structures [your general Drupal knowledge]. To create a menu link that points to a route you've defined, you typically create a module.links.menu.yml file in your custom module [your general Drupal knowledge, likely detailed in the "Creating modules" documentation]. This file defines the menu links, specifying the menu they belong to, the title of the link, and the route it should point to [your general Drupal knowledge].
Again, the provided excerpts don't give the exact syntax for a module.links.menu.yml file, but the "Working with menus Menu" link, likely elaborated upon in the broader "Drupal User Guide (D.O)", will explain how to configure menus and menu links. The "Creating custom modules (D.O)" link should also cover the specifics of defining menu links within a custom module. This documentation will likely explain:
•
Defining the menu to which the link will be added (e.g., main).
•
Setting the title of the menu link.
•
Specifying the route_name that the link should point to (this corresponds to the name you gave your route in the routing.yml file).
•
Optionally setting weight to control the order of links and parent to create hierarchical menus.
In summary, to register paths and define how URL requests are handled in Drupal:
•
You utilise the Routing system by defining routes in a routing.yml file within your custom module [your general Drupal knowledge]. This involves specifying the path, the controller to execute, access requirements, and other parameters [your general Drupal knowledge]. The "Creating custom modules (D.O)" link is your primary resource for detailed instructions on this.
•
You integrate these paths into Drupal's navigation using the Menu API by defining menu links in a module.links.menu.yml file in your custom module [your general Drupal knowledge]. This involves specifying the menu, the link title, and the route name it should point to [your general Drupal knowledge]. The "Working with menus Menu" link and the "Creating custom modules (D.O)" link will provide the necessary details.
Understanding and utilizing both the Routing system and the Menu API are essential skills for back-end Drupal development, allowing you to create custom functionality and integrate it seamlessly into your Drupal website. The provided links to the Drupal documentation are crucial for gaining a practical understanding of how to implement these concepts.
