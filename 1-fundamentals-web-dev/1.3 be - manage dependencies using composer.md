Composer is the standard dependency manager for PHP and is crucial for managing Drupal core, contributed modules and themes, and other PHP libraries. It allows you to define the dependencies your Drupal project needs in a composer.json file. Composer then resolves and downloads the correct versions of these dependencies, ensuring that your project has everything it needs to run.

Here's why Composer is important in the context of Drupal development:

• Dependency Management: Composer handles the complexities of managing project dependencies. Instead of manually downloading and tracking the versions of modules and themes, you declare them in your composer.json file, and Composer takes care of the rest.

• Autoloading: Composer provides an autoloader that allows your PHP code to easily find and use the classes from the installed dependencies without requiring manual require statements for every file.

• Project Structure: Composer helps establish a standard project structure for Drupal, making it easier to manage and deploy your site.

• Updating Dependencies: Composer simplifies the process of updating Drupal core, contributed modules, and themes to the latest versions.

• Reproducibility: The composer.lock file ensures that everyone working on the project uses the exact same versions of dependencies, leading to more consistent development and deployment environments.


While the provided "Acquia Certified Drupal Developer self.pdf" doesn't delve into Composer specifically, the broader context of "Back-end development (coding)" and the ability to "develop custom modules using Drupal API for extending Drupal functionality" [4.2] often involves using Composer to manage dependencies for these custom developments or for the Drupal project as a whole.
To learn more about managing dependencies using Composer in Drupal, referring to the official Drupal.org documentation you've linked is the recommended next step. This documentation will provide detailed explanations and instructions on how to use Composer for your Drupal projects.


The composer.json file is the core configuration file for Composer. It lives in the root directory of your PHP project (including Drupal projects) and describes the project's dependencies, autoloading rules, and other metadata.

Here are some common sections you might find in a composer.json file:
• name: This specifies the package name, typically in the format vendor/package. For a Drupal project, this might be something like drupal/my-project.
• type: This defines the package type. For a full Drupal project, this is often project. For a Drupal module or theme, it would be drupal-module or drupal-theme respectively. This helps package managers like Composer and Drush understand how to handle the package.
• description: A short, human-readable description of the project.
• license: The license under which the project is distributed.
• require: This is a crucial section that lists the production dependencies of your project. These are the packages that your code needs to run in a production environment. Each dependency is listed with a name and a version constraint (e.g., drupal/core-recommended: ^9.2). The version constraint specifies which versions of the package are acceptable.
• require-dev: This section lists the development dependencies. These are packages that are only needed during development, such as testing frameworks (like PHPUnit), code quality tools (like PHPStan or Psalm), and debugging aids. These are typically not required when the project is deployed to a production server.
• repositories: This section allows you to specify additional sources from which Composer can download packages. This might include private repositories or alternative package mirrors.
• autoload: This section defines how Composer should map namespaces to the physical directories containing the corresponding PHP classes. This is essential for Composer's autoloader to function correctly.
• autoload-dev: Similar to autoload, but this section defines autoloading rules specifically for development dependencies.
• scripts: This section allows you to define custom commands that can be executed using Composer. For example, you might define scripts to run tests, clear cache, or perform deployments.
• extra: This section can contain project-specific configuration. For Drupal projects, this often includes information about the installer paths for contributed modules and themes, managed by the drupal/core-composer-scaffold package.

A dev dependency (listed under require-dev) is a package that is only required for the development and testing phases of a project, but not for the application to run in a production environment.

Examples of dev dependencies include:
• Testing frameworks (e.g., PHPUnit, Behat): Used to write and run automated tests.
• Code quality tools (e.g., PHPStan, Psalm, ESLint, Stylelint): Used to analyze code for potential errors, enforce coding standards, and improve code quality.
• Debugging tools (e.g., Xdebug): Used to step through code and identify issues.
• Code generators: Tools that can automatically generate code based on certain configurations.

The benefit of separating dependencies into require and require-dev is that when you install the production version of your application (e.g., using composer install --no-dev), only the necessary runtime dependencies are downloaded and installed, leading to a smaller and more efficient production environment.

In the context of Drupal, while the sources don't mention composer.json directly, managing dependencies with Composer is the standard way to handle Drupal core, contributed modules, and themes, as well as any other PHP libraries your project might need. This often includes specifying development-related tools as dev dependencies.
