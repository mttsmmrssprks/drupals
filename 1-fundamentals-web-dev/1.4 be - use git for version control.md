You're asking for examples and key commands related to demonstrating the ability to **use Git for version control**, as listed in the "Acquia Certified Drupal Developer self-assessment table" under item **1.3**. You've also provided resources to help understand this topic [your query].

Here are some examples of common Git workflows and key commands, drawing on general Git knowledge and aligning with the provided resource links (although the specific content within those links isn't directly quoted here):

**Example Git Workflows:**

*   **Basic Local Workflow:** This involves working on a project locally and using Git to track changes.
    *   You might start by **initialising a Git repository** in your project directory.
    *   Then, you'll **make changes** to your files.
    *   You'll **stage your changes** to prepare them for a commit.
    *   Finally, you'll **commit your changes** with a descriptive message.

*   **Collaborative Workflow using a Remote Repository:** This involves working with others by pushing and pulling changes to a shared repository (e.g., on platforms like Bitbucket, as mentioned in one of your links).
    *   One person might **create a repository** on the remote platform.
    *   Other collaborators will **clone** this repository to their local machines.
    *   Each person will work on their local copy, making changes, staging, and committing.
    *   To share their work, they will **push** their local commits to the remote repository.
    *   To get the latest changes from others, they will **pull** from the remote repository.

*   **Feature Branch Workflow:** This is a common and recommended workflow for larger projects. It involves creating separate branches for each new feature or bug fix.
    *   You start by creating a new **branch** from the main branch (often called `main` or `master`).
    *   You work on this feature branch, making commits as needed.
    *   Once the feature is complete, you **merge** your feature branch back into the main branch.
    *   This keeps the main branch stable and isolates development work.

**Key Git Commands:**

Here are some fundamental Git commands that are essential for these workflows:

*   **`git init`**: **Initialises a new Git repository** in the current directory [your query]. This is the first step in version-controlling an existing project.

*   **`git clone <repository_url>`**: **Creates a local copy of a remote repository** [your query]. This is how you get a project onto your local machine when collaborating or working with an existing repository.

*   **`git status`**: **Shows the current status of your working directory and staging area** [your query]. It tells you which files have been modified, staged, or are untracked.

*   **`git add <file(s)>`**: **Stages changes in the specified files for the next commit** [your query]. You can use `git add .` to stage all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories.

*   **`git commit -m "<commit message>"`**: **Records the staged changes with a descriptive message** [your query]. The commit message should summarise the changes made.

*   **`git push <remote_name> <branch_name>`**: **Uploads your local commits to a remote repository** [your query]. `<remote_name>` is typically `origin` for the main remote repository, and `<branch_name>` is the branch you want to push (e.g., `main` or a feature branch).

*   **`git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>`**: **Downloads changes from a remote repository and integrates them into your current branch** [your query]. This is how you get the latest updates from others.

*   **`git branch`**: **Lists your local branches** [your query]. You can also use `git branch -r` to list remote branches or `git branch -a` to list all branches.

*   **`git checkout <branch_name>`**: **Switches to the specified branch** [your query]. You can also create and switch to a new branch with `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`.

*   **`git merge <branch_name>`**: **Integrates the changes from the specified branch into your current branch** [your query]. This is used to combine feature branches back into the main branch.

*   **`git log`**: **Shows a history of commits** [your query]. You can use various options to format the output and see more details.

The resources you provided, "**tutorial-learn-bitbucket-with-git**" and "**git/workflows**" on Atlassian, will offer much more detailed explanations and examples of these concepts and commands. They will likely cover these basic workflows in more depth and introduce more advanced Git features and strategies [your query].

Understanding and being able to use these key commands and workflows is crucial for demonstrating your ability to use Git for version control, a fundamental skill for web development.
