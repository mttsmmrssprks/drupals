1.2 Identify PHP programming concepts
A front-end specialist should have knowledge of PHP syntax, including but not limited to:

PHP basic syntax
Use of general PHP functions as well as Drupal specific ones.
Variable handling, manipulation and use.
Control structures.
Basic object manipulation.
Basic error handling.


Right then, let's turn our attention to PHP. You're looking to solidify your understanding of PHP programming concepts relevant to a front-end specialist preparing for the Acquia Certified Drupal Developer exam, and you've listed some key areas. Let's see what the sources tell us that can help.

The self-assessment table under the "Back-end development (coding)" domain specifically mentions the ability to "write code using core and object-oriented PHP" [4.1]. This directly aligns with your interest in PHP syntax and basic object manipulation.

Furthermore, the sources highlight the importance of the Drupal API for extending Drupal functionality through custom modules [4.2]. While you're approaching this from a front-end perspective, a grasp of how Drupal's API interacts with PHP is beneficial. Source suggests that understanding Drupal’s API is crucial for the exam. It also points to the Examples module as a resource for "highly documented working code snippets for many of the Drupal APIs and concepts covered under Sections 4.1 and 4.2". This could be a valuable tool for seeing PHP and Drupal API usage in action.

Source also provides a link to "Drupal APIs", indicating that this is a key area to explore further. Additionally, it links to "Object Oriented Programming Getting started - Background & Prerequisites", reinforcing the importance of understanding object-oriented PHP as mentioned in [4.1].

[Added link to this in the miscellaneous section]("/miscellaneous/TO%20DO%20-%20review%20the%20examples%20module.md") The Examples module is specifically recommended for understanding Drupal APIs and PHP concepts, which can be particularly useful for a front-end specialist looking to understand how PHP integrates with Drupal.

## PHP overview

Considering your list of PHP concepts, here's how they relate to the information in the sources:

• PHP basic syntax: The expectation to "write code using core ... PHP" [4.1] inherently requires knowledge of basic PHP syntax. The Examples module would demonstrate this syntax in practical Drupal contexts.

• Use of general PHP functions as well as Drupal specific ones: Source [4.4] mentions the ability to "work with other essential APIs", which would include both general PHP functions and Drupal-specific API functions. The Examples module is specifically recommended for understanding Drupal APIs.

• Variable handling, manipulation and use: This is a fundamental aspect of PHP programming and is implied in the ability to "write code using core ... PHP" [4.1] and work with Drupal APIs [4.4]. The code examples in the Examples module would certainly demonstrate variable handling.

• Control structures: Similar to variable handling, control structures (like if, else, for, while) are essential for writing PHP code [4.1] and would be evident in the Examples module.

• Basic object manipulation: The self-assessment explicitly mentions the ability to "write code using ... object-oriented PHP" [4.1], and source provides a link to resources on Object Oriented Programming. This indicates that understanding how to create and interact with objects in PHP is a necessary skill.

• Basic error handling: While not explicitly listed as a separate point in the self-assessment's PHP section, the ability to "analyze and resolve site performance issues arising from ... custom code" [4.6] and "analyze and resolve security issues arising from ... custom code" [4.7] implicitly requires an understanding of basic error handling in PHP to identify and debug problems.

In summary, to study PHP concepts relevant to the Acquia Certified Drupal Developer exam as a front-end specialist, you should focus on:

### Core PHP syntax, variable handling, control structures, and general PHP functions, as these form the foundation of any PHP coding [4.1].

The foundation of being able to "write code using core ... PHP" [4.1] inherently rests on understanding these fundamental building blocks. While the sources don't provide explicit lessons on PHP syntax, they establish it as a prerequisite skill. The recommendation to explore the Examples module for "highly documented working code snippets" implies that examining this code will expose you to PHP syntax in a Drupal context. You'll see how variables are declared and used, how control structures like if statements and loops are employed, and how general PHP functions are called to perform various operations. This hands-on approach, looking at real code examples within the Drupal environment, aligns with the suggestion to find "enough practical case studies covering the topics".

### Object-oriented PHP principles, as this is specifically mentioned in the back-end development requirements [4.1] and further resources are provided.

The self-assessment explicitly mentions the ability to "write code using ... object-oriented PHP" [4.1]. This signifies that understanding concepts like classes, objects, properties, methods, inheritance, and encapsulation is important. The source provides a direct link to "Object Oriented Programming Getting started - Background & Prerequisites", indicating that this is a specific area you should study. While the source doesn't detail these concepts themselves, it points you to resources that do. Furthermore, Drupal's API and plugin system heavily leverage object-oriented principles, so understanding these concepts will be crucial when you move on to Drupal-specific functions.

### Understanding and using Drupal-specific API functions, as this is key to extending Drupal's functionality [4.2, 4.4, 9, 16]. The Examples module is a suggested resource for seeing this in practice.

The ability to "develop custom modules using Drupal API for extending Drupal functionality" [4.2] and to "work with other essential APIs" [4.4] is a core expectation for Drupal development. The sources repeatedly emphasise the importance of the Drupal API. The Examples module is specifically suggested as a way to see the application of many Drupal APIs in practice. This aligns with the need to find "knowledge resources" and "sufficient practical case studies". By studying the Examples module, you can observe how Drupal provides functions and services to interact with its various systems (e.g., content, users, database). The link to "Drupal APIs" suggests further documentation is available on this topic. Understanding the Drupal API is essential for any custom development, whether you are building a full module or writing custom logic within a theme's preprocess functions (as mentioned in [3.5]).


### While not a primary focus for a front-end specialist, a basic understanding of error handling in PHP will be beneficial for understanding potential issues and how code functions [4.6, 4.7].

While not a primary listed requirement under "Back-end development", the ability to "analyze and resolve site performance issues arising from ... custom code" [4.6] and "analyze and resolve security issues arising from ... custom code" [4.7] implies a need for basic error handling knowledge in PHP. When code doesn't function as expected, or when security vulnerabilities arise, understanding how to identify and debug errors (e.g., using error_reporting, try...catch blocks, and examining logs) is crucial. Although the sources don't explicitly detail PHP error handling techniques, the expectation to resolve issues in custom code necessitates this understanding.
