# Documentation

This is documentation for our Drupal 10 website, and a study guide for passing accreditation exams.

## Custom documentation



## Sources for documentation

This is also used for Drupal 10 learning, based on documentation mostly provided by Drupal.org, organised around the developer exams led by Acquia.

The documentation focuses on the Front End and Back End specialist exams. These exam outlines are here:

- [Drupal 10 Developer](https://docs.acquia.com/acquia-academy/study-guides/d10-certified-developer)

- [Drupal 10 Front End Specialist](https://docs.acquia.com/acquia-academy/study-guides/d10-front-end-specialist)

- [Drupal 10 Back End Specialist](https://docs.acquia.com/acquia-academy/study-guides/backend-specialist)

It primarily focuses on the front end (FE) and back end (BE) guides, which together address the content in the more general Drupal 10 Developer exam.
