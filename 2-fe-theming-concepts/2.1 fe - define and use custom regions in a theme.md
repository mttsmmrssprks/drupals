Great, thank you. Let's focus on front end things for a while.


2.1 Demonstrate ability to define and use custom regions in a theme
A front-end specialist should have experience defining custom regions, printing those regions out in the proper templates, and creating conditional display logic for when to print regions.

Right then, let's turn our attention to **front-end development** and specifically the ability to **define and use custom regions in a Drupal theme**, which a front-end specialist should be able to do [your query].

Defining custom regions in your theme involves modifying your theme's `.info.yml` file [Adding regions to a theme]. This file is where you declare the **regions** that your theme will provide for placing blocks [Adding regions to a theme]. You would add a `regions` key to your `.info.yml` file, and under that, list your custom region names along with human-readable labels [Adding regions to a theme]. For example:

```yaml
name: my_custom_theme
type: theme
description: A custom Drupal theme.
core_version_requirement: ^8.8 || ^9 || ^10
base_theme: stable9

regions:
  header_top: 'Header Top'
  content_top: 'Content Top'
  sidebar_first: 'Sidebar First'
  content: 'Content'
  sidebar_second: 'Sidebar Second'
  footer_bottom: 'Footer Bottom'
```

In this example, `header_top`, `content_top`, etc., are the **machine names** of the custom regions, and 'Header Top', 'Content Top', etc., are the **labels** that will appear in the Block Layout administration page [Adding regions to a theme].

Once you have defined your custom regions in the `.info.yml` file, you need to **print them out in the appropriate Twig templates** [your query]. The `page.html.twig` template is the primary template for rendering the overall structure of your Drupal pages [page.html.twig (API)]. Within this template, you can output the content of your defined regions using the `page` variable, followed by the machine name of the region [page.html.twig (API)]. For instance, to render the `header_top` region, you would typically place the following code in your `page.html.twig` file:

```twig
{% if page.header_top %}
  <div class="header-top">
    {{ page.header_top }}
  </div>
{% endif %}
```

The `{% if page.header_top %}` part demonstrates the creation of **conditional display logic** [your query]. This ensures that the `header-top` div and its contents (any blocks placed in that region) are only rendered if the region actually contains any blocks [your query, page.html.twig (API)]. This is good practice to avoid empty HTML elements on pages where a particular region is not being used. You would repeat this pattern for all the custom regions you've defined in your `.info.yml` file, placing them in the desired locations within the structural markup of your `page.html.twig` template [page.html.twig (API)].

Furthermore, you might need to print regions in other templates besides `page.html.twig`, such as node templates or block templates, if you want to create specific layouts within those contexts. The same principle applies: you use the `page` variable (if available in that template's scope) followed by the machine name of the region, wrapped in a conditional statement to check if the region has content [your query].

In summary, demonstrating the ability to define and use custom regions involves:

*   **Declaring the regions** in the theme's `.info.yml` file [Adding regions to a theme].
*   **Printing the regions** in the appropriate Twig templates (most commonly `page.html.twig`) using the `page` variable and the region's machine name [page.html.twig (API)].
*   Implementing **conditional logic** to ensure regions are only rendered if they contain content, preventing empty markup [your query, page.html.twig (API)].

These steps allow you to create a flexible theme structure with specific areas where content (in the form of blocks) can be placed and managed through Drupal's administrative interface.
