2.4 Demonstrate knowledge of working with Javascript in a theme
A front-end specialist should have experience writing custom Javascript and jQuery for Drupal. They should be comfortable using Drupal’s Javascript API and be familiar with Drupal’s javascript coding standards. They should be able to conditionally load javascript.

Right then, let's delve into demonstrating knowledge of **working with Javascript in a Drupal theme**. A front-end specialist working with Drupal should indeed have experience writing custom Javascript and jQuery, be comfortable using Drupal’s Javascript API, be familiar with Drupal’s javascript coding standards, and be able to conditionally load javascript [your query].

Similar to how CSS is added to a Drupal theme, the best practice for including custom Javascript and jQuery is by **declaring them in your theme's `your_theme.libraries.yml` file** [CSS and Javascript]. Within this file, you can define libraries that contain your Javascript files. For instance:

```yaml
global-scripts:
  version: 1.x
  js:
    js/script.js: {}
    js/jquery.custom.js: {}
  dependencies:
    - core/jquery
    - core/drupal
```

In this example, `global-scripts` is the name of the library, and `js/script.js` and `js/jquery.custom.js` are the paths to your Javascript files within your theme's `js` directory. The `dependencies` section indicates that this library depends on Drupal's core jQuery and Drupal Javascript libraries [CSS and Javascript]. You would then **attach this library to your theme** globally in your theme's `.info.yml` file or to specific parts of your site using templates or pre-process functions [CSS and Javascript].

Drupal provides a **Javascript API** which offers a set of tools and conventions for writing Javascript within the Drupal environment [Javascript API]. This API helps ensure that your custom Javascript interacts correctly with Drupal's core Javascript and other modules or themes. Key aspects of the Drupal Javascript API include:

*   **Drupal behaviors:** These are used to attach Javascript functionality to elements on the page after the DOM has loaded and after AJAX requests have completed. This ensures that your Javascript works reliably even with dynamically added content [Javascript API].
*   **AJAX framework:** Drupal has a built-in AJAX framework that simplifies making asynchronous requests and updating parts of the page without a full reload [Javascript API].
*   **Dialog API:** This allows you to create modal dialog boxes using Javascript [Javascript API].
*   **Utility functions:** The API provides various utility functions for common tasks [Javascript API].

While the provided sources don't explicitly detail **Drupal's javascript coding standards**, it's crucial for a front-end specialist to adhere to them [your query]. These standards promote consistency, readability, and maintainability of Javascript code within the Drupal ecosystem. Following established best practices, such as using consistent coding styles, properly commenting code, and avoiding global variables, is generally expected. You can likely find detailed information on Drupal's Javascript coding standards on the Drupal.org website [this information is generally known within the Drupal community but not explicitly stated in the sources].

**Conditionally loading Javascript** is an important technique for optimising your theme's performance [your query]. Similar to conditional CSS loading, you can load Javascript files only when they are needed. This can be achieved through:

*   **Attaching libraries in specific templates or pre-process functions:** You can attach a Javascript library only when a particular template is being rendered or when a specific condition is met in a pre-process function. For example, you might only load a carousel script on the homepage template [CSS and Javascript].
*   **Using Drupal behaviors with context:** You can write your Javascript behaviors to only apply to certain elements or sections of the page based on specific conditions [Javascript API].

In summary, demonstrating knowledge of working with Javascript in a Drupal theme involves understanding how to **include Javascript files** using the `libraries.yml` file [CSS and Javascript], being proficient in using **Drupal's Javascript API** for interactive functionality [Javascript API], adhering to **Drupal's Javascript coding standards** [your query], and implementing **conditional loading** strategies for performance optimisation [your query, CSS and Javascript, Javascript API].
