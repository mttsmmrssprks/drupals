2.3 Demonstrate knowledge of working with stylesheets
A front-end specialist should be familiar with CSS and Drupalâ€™s best practices for writing and organizing CSS. They should be able to add their own stylesheets to a theme, be familiar with the ways Drupal aggregates stylesheets, be familiar with how Drupal orders stylesheets, and be able to conditionally load stylesheets.

Right then, let's discuss demonstrating knowledge of **working with stylesheets** in Drupal. A front-end specialist should indeed be familiar with CSS and Drupal's best practices for writing and organising CSS. They should be able to add their own stylesheets to a theme, understand how Drupal aggregates and orders stylesheets, and be able to conditionally load them [your query].

Firstly, a foundational understanding of **CSS** itself is crucial [CSS]. This involves knowing how to use selectors, properties, and values to style HTML elements and create the visual presentation of a website [CSS].

When it comes to **adding your own stylesheets to a Drupal theme**, the recommended approach is to declare them in your theme's `your_theme.libraries.yml` file [CSS and Javascript]. This file allows you to define reusable collections of CSS and JavaScript assets. For example, you might define a library for your theme's base styles:

```yaml
global-styling:
  version: 1.x
  css:
    theme:
      css/style.css: {}
```

Here, `global-styling` is the name of the library, and `css/style.css` is the path to your stylesheet within your theme's directory. Once you've defined your library, you can **attach it to your theme** in your theme's `.info.yml` file or within specific templates or pre-process functions [CSS and Javascript]. To attach it globally to your theme, you would add the following to your `.info.yml` file:

```yaml
name: my_custom_theme
type: theme
description: A custom Drupal theme.
core_version_requirement: ^8.8 || ^9 || ^10
base_theme: stable9

libraries:
  - my_custom_theme/global-styling
```

**Drupal aggregates stylesheets** to improve website performance by reducing the number of HTTP requests [CSS and Javascript]. When CSS aggregation is enabled (which is the default in production environments), Drupal combines multiple CSS files into fewer, larger files. The order in which stylesheets are declared and attached influences the order in which they are aggregated [CSS and Javascript].

The **order of stylesheets** is important because CSS rules cascade, meaning that later rules can override earlier ones [CSS]. Drupal determines the order of stylesheets based on several factors, including:

*   The weight of the module or theme that provides the stylesheet.
*   The order in which libraries are attached.
*   Specific weights that can be assigned to individual CSS files within a library definition (though this is less commonly used for entire theme stylesheets).

Understanding this ordering is crucial for ensuring that your theme's styles are applied correctly and are not unexpectedly overridden by other stylesheets [CSS].

Finally, **conditionally loading stylesheets** allows you to load specific CSS files only on certain pages or under certain conditions [your query]. This can improve performance by preventing unnecessary styles from being loaded where they are not needed. You can achieve conditional loading in Drupal through:

*   **Attaching libraries in specific templates or pre-process functions:** You can attach a library (and thus its associated CSS) only when a particular template is being rendered or a specific condition is met in a pre-process function [CSS and Javascript].
*   **Using Drupal's routing system:** You can define specific libraries to be attached to certain routes in your module's or theme's routing files (though this is more common for module-specific assets).

In summary, demonstrating knowledge of working with stylesheets in Drupal involves understanding CSS fundamentals [CSS], knowing how to **declare and attach stylesheets** using `libraries.yml` files [CSS and Javascript], being aware of **Drupal's CSS aggregation** mechanisms and how the **order of stylesheets** is determined [CSS and Javascript, CSS], and having the ability to **conditionally load stylesheets** for optimization [your query, CSS and Javascript].
