Right then, let's explore demonstrating knowledge of **working with breakpoints in a Drupal theme**. A front-end specialist should indeed know how to **define and use a common set of breakpoints** throughout a site and be proficient in **CSS media queries** for targeting a wide variety of devices [your query].

In Drupal, breakpoints are typically defined within your theme's `.breakpoints.yml` file [Working with Breakpoints in Drupal]. This file allows you to **declare a set of named breakpoints** with specific media query conditions [Working with Breakpoints in Drupal]. For example, you might define breakpoints for small, medium, and large screens like this:

```yaml
your_theme.screen-small:
  label: Small
  mediaQuery: '(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 575px)'
  weight: 0
your_theme.screen-medium:
  label: Medium
  mediaQuery: '(min-width: 576px) and (max-width: 991px)'
  weight: 1
your_theme.screen-large:
  label: Large
  mediaQuery: '(min-width: 992px)'
  weight: 2
```

Here, each breakpoint has a **machine name** (`your_theme.screen-small`), a **human-readable label** (`Small`), a **CSS media query** (`(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 575px)`), and a **weight** to determine their order [Working with Breakpoints in Drupal].

Once you have defined your breakpoints in the `.breakpoints.yml` file, you can **use them in various parts of your theme**, most notably in your theme's `your_theme.theme` file or within Twig templates [Working with Breakpoints in Drupal]. This allows you to load different stylesheets, use different image styles, or implement different layouts based on the active breakpoint [Working with Breakpoints in Drupal].

**CSS media queries** are a fundamental aspect of creating responsive designs [Using media queries]. They allow you to **apply different styles for different media types or devices** [Using media queries]. The `mediaQuery` property in your `.breakpoints.yml` file uses standard CSS media query syntax [Working with Breakpoints in Drupal]. As the user mentioned, a front-end specialist should be **proficient in constructing these media queries** to target a wide variety of devices and screen sizes effectively [your query]. Common media features you might use include `width`, `height`, `orientation`, `resolution`, and `aspect-ratio` [Using media queries]. You can combine multiple media features using logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not` [Using media queries].

**Best practices for working with breakpoints** in a Drupal theme include [Working with Breakpoints in Drupal]:

*   **Defining a clear and consistent set of breakpoints:** Choose breakpoints that make sense for your content and design, and use them consistently throughout your site.
*   **Using meaningful labels:** Clear labels for your breakpoints will make your `.breakpoints.yml` file easier to understand and maintain.
*   **Ordering breakpoints correctly using the 'weight' property:** Ensure that breakpoints are processed in the intended order.
*   **Avoiding overly specific breakpoints:** Aim for a manageable number of breakpoints that cover the most common screen sizes.
*   **Testing thoroughly on various devices:** Always test your responsive design on a range of devices and screen sizes to ensure it works as expected.

In summary, demonstrating knowledge of working with breakpoints in a Drupal theme involves understanding how to **define breakpoints in the `.breakpoints.yml` file** [Working with Breakpoints in Drupal], being well-versed in **CSS media query syntax** [Using media queries, Working with Breakpoints in Drupal], and knowing how to **utilise these breakpoints within your theme** to create responsive layouts [Working with Breakpoints in Drupal].
