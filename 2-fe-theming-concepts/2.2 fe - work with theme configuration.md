Right then, let's move on to **demonstrating the ability to work with theme configuration**. A front-end specialist should indeed be familiar with administrative theme settings and be capable of creating their own theme settings using custom code [your query].

Out of the box, Drupal provides a set of **administrative settings for themes**. These can typically be found by navigating to **Appearance** in the Drupal administration menu and then clicking on the **Settings** link for your active theme [this information is generally known within Drupal but not explicitly stated in the sources]. These settings often allow you to control basic aspects of your theme, such as toggling the display of the site name, logo, or slogan. The exact settings available will depend on the specific theme you are using.

However, to create **your own theme settings using custom code**, you would typically follow the process outlined in the "Creating advanced theme settings" resource [Creating advanced theme settings]. This involves several key steps:

*   **Defining the settings form** in your theme's `.theme` file (for Drupal 8 and later) or in a custom module. This is done using the Drupal Form API [Creating advanced theme settings]. You would define fields for the settings you want to expose, such as text fields, checkboxes, select lists, etc. [Creating advanced theme settings]. For example, you might want to allow administrators to change the site's primary colour or upload a custom background image.

*   **Specifying the default values** for your custom settings within the form definition [Creating advanced theme settings].

*   **Saving the submitted settings** to the theme's configuration. Drupal's configuration management system handles this automatically when the form is submitted and saved correctly [Creating advanced theme settings].

*   **Accessing the theme settings** in your Twig templates and pre-process functions. You can retrieve the saved configuration values using the `config()` function in Twig or the `\Drupal::config()` method in PHP [Creating advanced theme settings]. For a theme named 'my_custom_theme', you would typically access your custom settings via `config('my_custom_theme.settings')`.

By creating your own theme settings, you empower site administrators or content editors to customise certain visual aspects or behaviours of the theme without needing to directly modify the theme's code [Creating advanced theme settings]. This makes the theme more flexible and user-friendly.

In summary, working with theme configuration involves both understanding and utilising the **built-in administrative settings** provided by themes and having the ability to **create custom settings** using Drupal's Form API and Configuration API [Creating advanced theme settings]. This allows for greater control and flexibility in how a theme can be configured and used.
